This is a digital font based on the Alethi women's script from the Stormlight Archive.

Contributors: Brandon Sanderson wrote the book series (the Stormlight Archive)
that the Alethi script is from, Isaac Stewart made the script and the number
glyphs, and I (River) designed a digital font from it and added some
characters.
